👋 Hi,

I'm really passionate about machine learning and artificial intelligence. Machine learning and artificial intelligence has been revolutionizing the way in which we live our lives. There are many machine learning algorithms that are being developed and there is a lot of scope and demand for it. I wanted to share my projects to the community so that they could get access the all the resources and tools needed in the field of data science. 

Data science starts with data visualization and exploratory data analysis (EDA). This analysis would give us a good understanding of the different ways at which our data is spread.
